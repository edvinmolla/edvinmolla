### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Edvin, an undergraduate at UCLA. I'm interested in using Machine Learning in developing models to understand the fundamental workings of our brain, energy systems, and the fundamental physics behind such phenomena. Currently, I'm participating in the 2023 NASA Lunar Conveyance Challenge, representing UCLA in a team of 8 undergraduates, led by Professor Peter Chi. In my free time, I like doign coding challenges, and working on personal projects.
